It has been a couple of months since my lastÂ post. I have been quite occupied with a big project where I am helping to modernize its archaic code-base.

On a daily basis, I spend a lot of time debugging and I am usually using several LLDB commands over and over again. For this purpose, I have defined a couple of custom LLDB commands like printing out the contents of `Data` as `String` - so instead of `po String(data: jsonData, encoding: .utf8)` I simply write `printData jsonData`

Since not many devs know about the opportunity to define own custom LLDB aliases or commands, I have put together a short video:

</center>

(Fun fact: The video was made with Keynote which I found quite useful for such task)

The example of `.lldbinit` file can be seen on my [gist].

Stay safe!
