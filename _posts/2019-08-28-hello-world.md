The time has come for me to start a blog. 

How did that happen?

Well, as I experiment more and more with SwiftUI working on my new project I have the urge to share some of my gained knowledge. Month ago there were limited number of blog posts related to SwiftUI and those that could be found were very helpful for me so now it is time to give back to the community :)
